internet-shop, bootstrap, responsive site, jquery, sliders, filters
This is a responsive site built with bootstrap. Catalogue on the left of index.html works on hover. You get to the menu with active links. 
When you open the link, you can see a list of products. When you hover over each, a black border appears around and the description appears below.
Filters by producer, color and label work. When you click on the second product you go to the page of a single product. Click on the button "Buy" and the cart will appear.
Design is quite different on smaller resolutions.
